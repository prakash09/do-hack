Letâ€™s now add more servers to the upstream group. We can do this easily with an add request:

# curl 'http://localhost:8080/upstream_conf?add=&upstream=backend&server=10.2.2.93:8000'
server 10.2.2.93:8000; # id=3







An HTTP GET for the upstream group returns a list of the servers in it with the ID numbers used to identify them in change operations:

$ curl http://localhost/upstream_conf?upstream=backend
server 192.168.56.101:80; # id=0
server 192.168.56.102:80; # id=1
server 192.168.56.103:80; # id=2
